# Development Process Integration

## Key Challenges

- PM gatekeeping
- Communicating value proposition
- Myths (ex: trying to address accessibility opens us up to liability)
- Time
- Cowboy code
- Intended audience
- Assumptions based on capability
- Known unknowns
- Capacity
- User feedback
- Survivor bias
- Who ultimately owns, especially when when worked on by multiple teams or addresses multiple concerns
- Dependencies
- Feeling like you’re a lone voice

## Solution Approaches 

- Client ask
- Legal liability 
- Successful external projects to reference
- User feedback
- Internal playbook for access-related customer support
- Proactive best practices
- Monitoring and analytics added earlier on in the process
- Who internally acted on data/feedback
- Self-motivated individual or team
- Funding allocation w/requests
- Organizations and events to reward accessibility in OSS work
- Move the industry to treat accessibility the same as security 
- Perceived perception and impact in society
- Frameworks enhancements and support
- Expand perception of accessibility to expand features/visibility/customizability 
- General increase of awareness in the frontend/UI space
- Fundamental tracker in an org’s repos
- Issue types for accessibility
- Better metadata infrastructure
- Creating accessibility advocates
- Dependabot-style reporting built into GitHub
- Focused effort on AI/LLM tooling
- Accessibility baked into more mature/Enterprise-grade service offerings 
- Better safeguards for whitelabel services

## Success Metrics

- Creation of accessibility advocates and presence of/growth of an accessibility team within an organization
- Accessibility-related user feedback:
  - Comes in at all
  - Decreases
  - Has positive reports
- Organizational resourcing begins to include accessibility-related efforts
- External certification and tracking for UI frameworks and related services
- Granular compatibility tables for assistive technology for mature UI frameworks and design systems
- Cost projections and estimates showing how expensive it gets when you don’t shift left
- No or less lawsuits
- More VPATS/Asking for a VPAT becomes more commonplace

## Action Plan

- Work to update the understanding of successful release criteria to pass automated and manual accessibility checks. Without it you can’t launch
- Develop an internal accessibility guide, positioned as foundational quality. Also be sure to give next steps past baseline awareness
- Create rituals to reach out to users to both collect feedback and socialize accessibility features
- Perform gap analysis: Where is accessibility not present where it should be?
- Create alternate solutions or workarounds for known accessibility issues while you work on a better, more systematic fix
- Identify and reach out to other people at your organization who are interested in accessibility

## Community Support Needs

- Cash awards and resource support from the big players in the technology space
- Identifying successful accessibility programs and projects that can be referenced
- Improve OSS hosting infrastructure with regards to accessibility
- Increasing awareness and giving more visibility to good resources
