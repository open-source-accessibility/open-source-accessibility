## Open Source Accessibility Summit Recap
We hosted the [Open Source Accessibility Summit](https://2025.allthingsopen.org/open-source-accessibility-summit) on Oct 12th in Raleigh. We brought together the disability, accessibility, and open source communities for meaningful dialogue and collaboration.

Together, we identified six priority challenge areas through community polling and engaged in structured discussions to develop actionable solutions. The resulting roadmap outlined in this  **[Open Source Accessibility repo](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility)** represents the collective expertise and commitment of summit attendees to drive measurable progress in open source accessibility.

## Themes
The themes we identified included:

1. **[Community Communication and Collaboration](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/community-communication-and-collaboration/community-communication-and-collaboration.md)**: Developers often work in isolation from the people who depend on accessibility features, creating a disconnect between technical implementation and real-world needs. Without meaningful involvement from users with disabilities throughout the development process, teams miss critical insights that could prevent accessibility barriers from being built into products.
2. **[Development Process Integration](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/development-process-integration/development-process-integration.md)**: Too many projects approach accessibility as a final checklist item rather than a foundational principle. Open source workflows frequently push accessibility considerations to the end of development cycles, when fixing issues becomes exponentially more expensive and time-consuming than building them in from the start.
3. **[Information and Documentation Gaps](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/information-and-documentation-gaps/information-and-documentation-gaps.md)**: Information about accessibility is too distributed, poorly organized, and often lacks standardization. There's no single place to learn comprehensively, and documentation is frequently inadequate or missing entirely. This makes it difficult for developers to find reliable, up-to-date guidance.
4. **[Lack of Awareness and Knowledge](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/lack-of-awareness-and-knowledge/lack-of-awareness-and-knowledge.md)**: Many developers remain unaware of the diverse ways people interact with technology and the specific barriers that poor design creates. This knowledge gap extends beyond technical implementation to include understanding user needs, legal obligations, available resources, and proven approaches to creating inclusive experiences.
5. **[Organizational and Leadership Challenges](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/organizational-and-leadership-challenges/organizational-and-leadership-challenges.md)**: Accessibility initiatives often fail due to insufficient executive support, unclear ownership structures, and competing priorities. When organizations don't establish dedicated accountability or invest in accessibility expertise, these efforts become vulnerable to budget cuts and shifting priorities that can undo years of progress.
6. **[Testing and Tooling Difficulties](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility/blob/main/Themes/testing-and-tooling-difficulties/testing-and-tooling-difficulties.md)**: Comprehensive accessibility testing requires significant manual effort and specialized knowledge that many teams lack. While automated tools provide valuable baseline checks, they cannot evaluate the full user experience or catch nuanced usability issues that only emerge through testing with actual assistive technology users.

## Next Steps
The Open Source Accessibility Summit represented a significant milestone in our collective journey toward making open source software accessible to all users. The success of this initiative depends on sustained community engagement beyond the summit. We invite you to:

* **Join the conversation** in dedicated channels in the [Open Source Accessibility Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/opensourceacc-kab3997/shared_invite/zt-39veighf6-ANp0KNyuMnITxGYMGCGFIA)
* **Lead or join working groups** to define roadmap items, set priorities, propose projects, and coordinate community work found in the [Open Source Accessibility Organization](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility)
* **Contribute to the implementation** to advance roadmap items (open issues, submit pull requests, write docs) in the [Open Source Accessibility Organization](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility)
* **Share your expertise** in upcoming community working sessions
* **Spread awareness** by sharing the roadmap from the [Open Source Accessibility repo](https://github.com/open-source-accessibility/open-source-accessibility) with your networks
